# Sonic CD Disassembly

This is an incomplete disassembly of Sonic CD for the Sega CD. Builds a working ISO, as long as you provide the rest of the files in the "original" folder. Unfortunately, I do not have the time or motivation to continue working on this, but hopefully this new home for the project will encourage others to contribute.

Special thanks to flamewing and TheStoneBanana for helping out and contributing, especially for R11A in the disassembly's infancy stages back in 2015.

## Building

The remaining original game files must be placed in `original/japan/`,
`original/usa/`, or `original/europe/` before building. Generated files are
written to `out/`.

On Windows, run `make.bat`, followed by `check.bat` to compare every rebuilt binary
with the originals.

On Linux, install Wine with 32-bit Windows application support or Steam Proton,
then run:

```sh
./make.sh
./check.sh
```

The Linux build uses Wine (or an automatically detected Steam Proton installation)
to run the checked-in, byte-exact Windows toolchain; the comparison script itself
uses the native `cmp` utility. Both scripts default to the USA release. Set
`REGION=0` for Japan or `REGION=2` for Europe, using the same value for both
commands:

```sh
REGION=2 ./make.sh
REGION=2 ./check.sh
```

Use a fresh `out/` directory after switching regions because the build overwrites
outputs but does not remove stale files first. If the Wine or Proton executable has
a custom name or path, set `WINE_BIN` or `PROTON_BIN` when running `make.sh`.
